# elm-widgets-charts (alpha)

This is the **unstable** release of `elm-widgets-charts`.
It _will_ move fast and with constant breaking change.
It is **NOT** advisable to use it in your projects - please wait until the stable version is released.

**Look above! Unstable!**

**elm-widgets-charts** is a composable and extensible charting library inspired by [terezka/elm-charts](https://www.elm-charts.org) and built on top of [gampleman/elm-visualization](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gampleman/elm-visualization/latest/).

- **gampleman/elm-visualization** is an incredible low-level library that has basically everything you need to build really custom charts. However, the learning curve can be a bit high, especially for developers that need to get things done fast and can't really spend the time learning how to build great visualizations.
- **terezka/elm-charts** is amazing for that exact use case. It uses a great API similar to `elm/html`. It is great to quickly get something looking good and you can customize it quite a lot. **You should use it** if you want something gorgeous quickly.

So why another library?

Well, I wanted to build something that is more opinionated than **terezka/elm-charts** so that I could deliver even more out of the box. Different constraints, different possibilities.
This is basically an experiment at this point. It uses an API that is inspired by elm-charts and aims to be extensible through elm-visualization.
